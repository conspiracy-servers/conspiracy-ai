# Conspiracy AI

This is an open-source rewrite of Conspiracy AI programmed in Node.js. Hopefully this rewrite will fix all the bugs in the old version & bring to life many new features! :D

## Reporting Faults

### Bugs & Errors

If you've noticed any bugs and/or errors in the code or experienced any while using the software, then please report them by creating a [bug report issue](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/conspiracy-ai/issues). Try to provide as much detail in the report as you can, steps on how to reproduce the bug is also crucial so that other contributors can help to confirm and fix it as soon as possible. Please don't write an essay though, just because it's called a report doesn't mean it's a college paper. Bullet point lists, screenshots (if applicable) and summaries with detail are about what you should be doing. For more information, see [the reporting bugs page](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/conspiracy-ai/).

### Crashes

Reporting crashes is more or less the same as what has been said above. However, we ask that you create a [crash report issue](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/conspiracy-ai/issues) instead and upload any associated crash report(s) along with it (if you have them). Don't worry about publicly sharing crash reports, as for the sake of your privacy they are automatically encrypted upon generation using a keypair that only we have the decryption key for. However, so you're aware they do contain a level of system and environment information to assist us with debugging. If you wish to provide these privately anyway, then please contact the main repository contributors over an appropriate secure and private means. For more information, see [the reporting crashes page](https://github.com/conspiracy-servers/conspiracy-ai/).
